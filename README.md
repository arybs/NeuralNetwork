# Project description
The main idea of the project was to create a **multilayer perceptron**.
Working of perceptron was tested on the classification of images (dataset available: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)).
Project was created as a part of university course (Introduction to AI).
# Perceptron
## Learning 
Learning is based on the backpropagation method. The connection weigths
changes after some data is processed. This idea was implemented with usage
of the stochastic gradient method.
